# builder-game-project
Builder game uses Python3 console to interact with players as they stack levels in this building game to win.
The game board is seen from an aerial view; meaning you have a bird's eye view of the squares. Each spot
shows what is placed there (if any players pieces) and how tall that block is. The first player to reach a 
height of 4 wins.

Players must make initial placement of x/o on the board.
After initial placements, players may move only one level up, but may jump multiple levels down.
The players will build and can move to spaces no more than 1 level higher, but may jump down
multiple levels.
